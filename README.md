LHSEngineeringProject
=====================

The LHS Engineering project is for Seniors at Lexington High School, where they are given a prompt and design a robot. This project was built for the 2014-2015 school year.

Our design is an electronic robot with two large wheels with gaps in the so the fit over the two by fours. In the center we have electronics and space for the eraser, which will be dropped when the vehicle rolls over the two by fours. It will move by an electric motor controlled by a microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry pi with pi face module, etc). It will be made out of 3D printer plastic parts that we will design in CAD software.

3D Models
=====================
3 parts are needed to be produced with a 3D printer.
 - Wheels
 - Body
 - Nut

These parts are all designed in CAD and then 3D printed with either ABS Plastic or PLA Plastic on a Makerbot Replicator 2x.
